    <h1>Rules of war game</h1>
    <p>The objective of the game is to win all cards.

The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck – this is a "battle" – and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. Aces are high, and suits are ignored.[1]

If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war". Both players place the next card of their pile face down, depending on the variant, and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all four (or six) cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's.</p>

    <p>In this version three cards are dealt in one round to make the game shorter.</p>
